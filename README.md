# GrayKnight Music Analytics

A data visualization application that analyzes your Spotify and Last.fm listening history to reveal music preferences, genre trends, and listening patterns through interactive charts and insights.

## Project Overview

This application provides a seamless music tracking experience by allowing users to authenticate with their Last.fm/Spotify account and retrieve their music listening history.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Secure JWT-based authentication
- Last.fm/Spotify account connection
- Music listening data retrieval

## Tech Stack

- Backend: Node.js, express
- ODM: Mongoose
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication:
  - Local registration
  - Passport.js for Last.fm/Spotify OAuth
- Frontend: Next.js (with shadcn)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Last.fm/Spotify Developer Account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
